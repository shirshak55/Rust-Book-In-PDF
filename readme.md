### Development
To run this project, please install [Bun](https://bun.sh/).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shirshak55/Rust-Book-In-PDF.git
bun install
bunx playwright install chromium
bun start
```

This will run the project and download all the books in the config.toml file. You can also run `bun start` with `DEBUG_ONLY_FRIST=true` to only download the first page of the book for easier debugging.

### Support us

You can support us by starring the repo. As the book is written by other people, I can't take any financial support.
